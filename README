Boilerplate code for creating flexible and clean RESTful services using Spring 3.
This project uses a java-based config and a JPA connection to a MySQL DB.
This project is also CORS aware and can be used easily with JQuery from another domain than the dataserver without any modifications.
Don't hesitate to fork and star the project if you like it.

The POM is inherited from another project that I don't remember, but has changed since from.

What you have to do to run this code
	- Change Application.class to connect your DB
	- Run Application.main() (Spring boot so no servlet container needed)
